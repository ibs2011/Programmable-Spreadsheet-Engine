# Programmable-Spreadsheet-Engine
A Python-based spreadsheet engine built with OOP. The Spreadsheet class allows other programmers to:

Create custom sheets with flexible row and column sizes

Manage and assign cell data

Use customizable commands and formulas (e.g., =A1 + B2, =A1 * 3) However they are not calculated using bidmas but in linearly

Output cell data in a structured format

This project acts as a base-phase mini spreadsheet language, enabling experimentation with formula parsing, OOP design, and custom command execution. It will soon be modular and extendable (similar to importable built-in module), allowing future enhancements like SUM, AVERAGE, and file import/export.
